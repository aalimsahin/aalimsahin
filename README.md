### Hi there👋 I am using Ethereum!

I'm a blockchain enthusiast. I'm always looking to build something innovative and fun.

🚀 **Current Focus**: I am one of the creators of the [Clave](https://getclave.io), a next-generation mobile wallet that integrates **hardware wallet security**, **easy onboarding**, and **account abstraction** to deliver a seamless **mobile experience**. We’re bridging the gap between everyday users and the world of **DeFi**, making decentralized finance accessible and secure for everyone. **Chain Abstraction**?? Working on it.


Got something cool in mind? Let's connect! You can check [my website](https://aalimsah.in) to reach me.
